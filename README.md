# Music Big Data Processing and Analysis

With the rapid development of the digital music industry, the scale and complexity of music data are continuously increasing. Major music platforms and streaming services generate vast amounts of user behavior data, song metadata, lyrics, and more every day. These data hold significant commercial value and research potential, such as user preference analysis, music recommendation systems, and artist popularity analysis.

To efficiently process and analyze these large-scale data, the MapReduce programming model has become a crucial tool. Through distributed computing, it can handle massive amounts of data efficiently and is easily scalable.

This project provides a comprehensive dataset on music and songs, covering various aspects from song features to artist metadata. Through this project, you will learn how to use MapReduce for large-scale music data processing and analysis, gaining skills from data preprocessing to complex analysis and modeling.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare raw music data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform complex analyses to uncover trends and insights.
- **Scalability:** Utilize the MapReduce programming model for efficient, scalable processing.
- **Real-world Applications:** Develop applications like music recommendation systems and user preference analysis.
